                <h2>Exhaustion vs. Burnout</h2>
                <p>I think it's important to distinguish between two states that often get conflated:</p>

                <p><strong>Exhaustion</strong> results from intense work hours and sleep deprivation. It's typically resolved with a short break or vacation (e.g., one week).</p>

                <p><strong>Burnout</strong> is more pervasive, affecting multiple life areas. It's deeper than exhaustion, and a short vacation isn't sufficient to resolve it.</p>

                <h2>What Actually Drives Burnout</h2>
                <p>Rather than pure overwork, burnout stems from more core feelings like motivation, recognition, and feeling good about the work you're doing.</p>

                <p>The critical factor isn't hours worked—it's uncertainty about work value combined with lack of recognition.</p>

                <h2>Motivation is Key</h2>
                <p>I see motivation as moldable and critical to preventing burnout. One approach I advocate for: set designated times for re-evaluating the value of programs. This reduces constant worry while maintaining critical evaluation of impact.</p>

                <p>If you're constantly questioning whether your work matters <em>while</em> doing the work, that's a recipe for burnout. Compartmentalizing reflection time helps.</p>

                <h2>Warning Sign</h2>
                <p>Getting sick more frequently than usual can indicate potential burnout risk. Illness can trigger a spiral: reduced productivity leads to increased stress, which leads to further illness.</p>

                <p>If you notice you're getting sick often, it might be worth examining whether burnout is building up.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    Work culture alone doesn't cause burnout—uncertainty about program value and neglecting motivation do.
                </blockquote>
