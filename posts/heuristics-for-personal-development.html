                <h2>How I Think About Personal Development</h2>

                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Personal development has been a huge unlock for me—I can now do things I couldn't before. But it's systematically neglected because it's not urgent and easy to deprioritize.</p>

                <p><strong>My biggest unlock:</strong> <a href="how-i-improved-my-wellbeing.html">Improving my well-being</a>—mental health work massively expanded what I could achieve. After seeing the results, I became more bullish on other forms of personal development.</p>

                <p>Some examples of stuff I've worked on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating a vision for a team</li>
                    <li>Learning Squiggle</li>
                    <li>Doing the AI Safety Fundamentals program</li>
                    <li>Practicing coaching and managing managers</li>
                    <li>Improving communication</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I haven't been perfect, but paying attention and putting in steady effort really helped.</p>

                <h2>Heuristics That Help Me Stick With It</h2>

                <h3>1. Tie it to your current work</h3>
                <p>You're most likely to succeed if there's a clear link to your actual projects and ultimate goals.</p>
                <p>Example: I wanted to improve communication. I was already making meeting docs, so I used those as practice for clarity.</p>
                <p>It's harder to prioritize if it's a totally separate, one-off project.</p>

                <h3>2. Build it into your routines and accountability</h3>
                <p>Reducing friction is key—there are too many blockers otherwise. My weekly agenda includes things like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Did you meditate every day?"</li>
                    <li>"What's something you worked on in coaching this week?"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Eventually it becomes part of your rhythm.</p>
                <p>Doing things with others helps too! Reading groups, accountability partners—but only when people are actually holding each other accountable.</p>

                <h3>3. Find opportunities within existing goals</h3>
                <p>Identify something you're already doing this quarter. Ask: <em>Can I put extra attention into it to also grow in a personal development area?</em></p>
                <p>Example: I had a talk coming up, so I put more time into it to work on communicating themes clearly.</p>

                <h2>Learning from Others</h2>
                <p>Books were hit-or-miss until I got better framing: no book is perfect—skim lots, take what makes sense, build your own model.</p>

                <p>My system now:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Audiobooks while walking, doing dishes, etc.</li>
                    <li>Jot down notes and "lessons learned"</li>
                    <li>Buy physical copies later for highlighting and sticky notes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This helps me absorb and refer back to stuff more easily.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>I've seen people (myself included) go from "area of weakness" in one performance review to "area of strength" in the next. That only happens with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clear goals</li>
                    <li>Integration into your actual work</li>
                    <li>Consistent follow-through</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    These improvements compound over time. If you get 10% faster and do it for two years? That adds up.
                </blockquote>
