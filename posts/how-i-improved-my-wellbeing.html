                <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> In late summer 2023, I realized mental health was blocking my goals. Over six months, I prioritized mental wellness through therapy, medication adjustments, meditation, and physical routines. By early 2024, I experienced significant improvements in clarity, productivity, and leadership capacity.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>During a performance review in late summer 2023, I identified mental health as the primary barrier to my growth. I had been diagnosed with depression years earlier; medication helped but breakthrough symptoms persisted. Mental health challenges were preventing me from achieving ambitious goals and making important work decisions.</p>

                <p>I made mental health improvement a top priority.</p>

                <p>By my next performance review in early 2024, I had made significant improvements. Colleagues noticed differences in my mood and decision-making quality. I had better affect in meetings—less reactive and more emotionally stable.</p>

                <h2>Key Improvements</h2>

                <p><strong>Fewer emotional breakdowns:</strong> I used to get caught in weekly (sometimes more) emotional breakdowns and thought spirals lasting hours. Now they occur less than monthly and are shorter and less severe, enabling clearer decision-making.</p>

                <p><strong>Increased productivity:</strong> I get more done with less self-doubt and improved focus on daily tasks.</p>

                <p><strong>Leadership impact:</strong> Mental health improvements translated to more calm, focused leadership with better capacity for team management.</p>

                <h2>What Made a Difference</h2>

                <h3>1. Therapy with the Right Therapist</h3>
                <p>Previous therapy experiences were negative, so I hesitated to try again for years. I used the <a href="https://www.mentnav.org/providers" target="_blank">EA Mental Health Navigator</a> to find a CBT-specialized therapist. I found CBT effective due to its evidence base.</p>

                <p>My therapist helped identify problematic thinking patterns and suggested practical coping strategies. The strong therapeutic relationship proved crucial—I attempted 4-5 other therapists after moving without finding a similar connection. I continue using CBT tools independently and through resources like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Great-Revolutionary-Treatment-Depression/dp/168373288X" target="_blank">"Feeling Great"</a>.</p>

                <h3>2. Medication Timing Adjustment</h3>
                <p>I switched from morning to evening antidepressant dosing (bupropion XL specifically). The result: significantly easier mornings, improved energy levels, and I became a morning person.</p>

                <p>This approach is less generalizable, but it's worth discussing timing adjustments with your doctor.</p>

                <h3>3. Meditation and Habit Tracking</h3>
                <p>I started regular meditation using the <a href="https://www.tenpercent.com/" target="_blank">10% Happier</a> app intro sequence and added meditation as a tracked weekly goal with manager accountability. I tracked meditation, exercise, and routines rigorously using a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1spis2qHsUWRqP0B4dvyflLhxmvE9T6cC9qQnSDxl_cY/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">wellness tracker</a>.</p>

                <p>When meditation stopped during summer, I noticed clear deterioration in thought control and emotional overwhelm. I now use the <a href="https://www.calm.com/" target="_blank">Calm</a> app instead.</p>

                <h3>4. 80,000 Hours Podcast Episodes</h3>
                <p>I found their mental health episodes helpful, particularly the one on <a href="https://80000hours.org/after-hours-podcast/episodes/luisa-keiran-free-will-guilt-shame/" target="_blank">free will</a> that helped me accept lack of control over everything, and the episode on <a href="https://80000hours.org/after-hours-podcast/episodes/hannah-boettcher-mental-health-challenges/" target="_blank">mental health challenges</a>.</p>

                <h3>5. Physical Routines</h3>

                <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> I prioritized finding enjoyable activities (workout classes with good music, social sports leagues). Weekly check-ins included workout frequency targets (more than 3 times weekly). The social element was particularly important for maintaining energy and positive affect.</p>

                <p><strong>Sleep:</strong> I established a consistent wake time within 30 minutes daily, even on vacations. I scheduled obligations and workout classes to enforce reasonable sleep duration.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    In six months, I went from frequent emotional breakdowns and decision paralysis to a place of more clarity, confidence, and emotional stability.
                </blockquote>

                <p>This journey continues, but these changes have profoundly impacted both my work and personal life.</p>

                <p><strong>Disclaimers:</strong> I'm still a work in progress with room for growth. This is one case study among many—others have achieved greater improvements. What worked for me may not work for everyone. I'm sharing this to resonate with others in similar situations.</p>
