                <p>I'm on Gather Town for most of the day and do nearly all of my work via Pomodoros. Different people have different preferences for how they run their Poms, so here's what works best for me when doing Poms with others!</p>

                <h2>Being Strict About the Timer</h2>
                <p>I really like being quite diligent about the timer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stick to 25-minute blocks (though I'm totally open to longer if everyone agrees beforehand that they need deeper focus time)</li>
                    <li>Stop at the end of each block</li>
                    <li>Set the 5-minute break timer right away</li>
                    <li>Restart as soon as the break ends</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's okay to work through a break every so often if you're particularly in the groove—especially if there are more than two people doing Poms and you can just step aside to let the others chat. There's definitely a time and place for grinding through when you need to keep going, but for the vast majority of the time it's good to keep to the timer and preserve that break time.</p>

                <h2>Setting Goals Before Each Pom</h2>
                <p>I think people should make very specific goals for what they're doing during their Pom if possible:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Either put them in the chat or share them with the group</li>
                    <li>When the Pom ends, everyone checks in on how they did on their goals</li>
                    <li>It's a nice accountability (and calibration) mechanism!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If there are more than five people doing Poms, I think you should split into two groups so that you're not spending the whole break just recapping everyone's progress.</p>

                <h2>What I Like During Breaks</h2>
                <p>After checking in on how things went, I usually like when there's a bit of a mixture:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Social talk—like what exciting or silly things are happening in people's lives</li>
                    <li>Some work talk about what people are working on or questions about each other's work</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I don't think you should have work questions every time, and generally it's nice when the work questions are not the exact same type of work you were just doing. But every so often (or even most of the time) it's okay to talk about work.</p>

                <h3>Personal Flexibility</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I don't typically do the recommended longer breaks every 3 or so Poms, but people are free to take them as they go</li>
                    <li>Sometimes I'll spend the first ten minutes of a Pom taking a longer break and let the other people keep going</li>
                    <li>Every few breaks or so, I might not stay and chat with people and instead go get a snack or take a bio break</li>
                    <li>But not every Pom break—because the social part is quite nice and valuable!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What I Really Value About Pomodoros</h2>
                <p>What I really value is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The social element and getting to know people outside of my team</li>
                    <li>The accountability element that keeps me on track</li>
                    <li>The time boxing structure for focused work</li>
                    <li>Learning what other teams are working on and thinking about</li>
                    <li>Sharing context and knowledge across the org—it's very helpful and nice</li>
                    <li>Forming better relationships with people across the organization</li>
                </ul>
