            <div class="post-content">
                <p><strong>Core principle:</strong> Treat Slack as asynchronous communication, even though it feels synchronous. If people need me immediately, they can call via Huddle or Facebook Messenger.</p>

                <h2>Step 1: Disable All Live Notifications</h2>
                <p>No pop-ups, no sounds, no bouncing icons at the bottom of the screen. This prevents constant interruption and context switching.</p>

                <h2>Step 2: Quick Triage Throughout the Day</h2>
                <p>I check Slack often throughout the day during Pomodoro breaks. For each message, I spend literally one second deciding: "Is this plausibly relevant for me?"</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If not relevant (e.g., someone else's daily check-in that I'm not actively monitoring), mark as seen and move on</li>
                    <li>If potentially relevant, use "Remind me in 20 minutes" so it goes in saved for later</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I have to be super disciplined here to not get sucked into Slack, and my pre-scheduled Pomodoros help make sure I don't spend too long.</p>

                <h3>The "Remind Me" Hack</h3>
                <p>The main goal is getting messages into Slack's remind-me list. To clear something from this list, you must actively check it off. This prevents accidentally losing important messages that got marked as read.</p>

                <h2>Step 3: Disciplined Inbox Clearing Sprints</h2>
                <p>I set a concrete goal: "I have 45 saved messages, getting below 10 by end of this Pomodoro." Goals make me work faster, and I often just beat them, which I consider evidence of them working.</p>

                <p>I apply the Getting Things Done method:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If I can reply in under 2 minutes → do it now</li>
                    <li>If it takes less than 20 minutes → add to Sunsama as a subtask under "Smalls"</li>
                    <li>Organize Smalls into: immediate (today), later, backlog</li>
                    <li>If it takes more than 20 minutes → add to Sunsama as a task</li>
                    <li>If no action needed → check it off</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step 4: Slack-Free Focused Work</h2>
                <p>I never have Slack open during Pomodoros (except inbox clearing ones). If I need to reference Slack messages, I copy them into a Google Doc first. If I want to send a message mid-Pomodoro, I draft it in Google Doc and send after.</p>

                <p>Most things can wait 25 minutes.</p>

                <h2>Step 5: Dedicated Small Task Sprints</h2>
                <p>I schedule focused time to knock out Slack-generated tasks under 15 minutes. Longer tasks get blocked into future days/weeks or deprioritized.</p>

                <h2>Key Insight</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    Separate "intake" (quick triage) from "processing" (quick responses, logging action points), and "doing" (taking action) to prevent constant context switching while ensuring nothing important gets lost.
                </blockquote>
