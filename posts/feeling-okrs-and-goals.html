                <h2>Feeling the Goal</h2>
                <p>It's easy to move through a quarter and realize you no longer feel connected to a goal. When a goal doesn't seem like it's achieving what you want, it's tempting to drop it. But by that point, it's often too late to adopt a new, meaningful goal.</p>

                <h2>Setting Goals Ahead of Time</h2>
                <p>You <em>need</em> to set your goals and plans ahead of time to stay on track. It's easy to overlook, but critical to map out personal development and other goals early.</p>

                <h2>Storytelling as Motivation</h2>
                <p>For personal development goals especially, being able to tell yourself a strong story matters. Ask yourself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Why does this goal matter to me?</em></li>
                    <li><em>How will achieving this positively affect me?</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Internalizing these answers can be a huge source of motivation.</p>

                <h2>Push for Clarity</h2>
                <p>If you don't fully understand or connect with a goal, don't ignore it. Have conversations with your manager or teammates to gain clarity and buy-in.</p>
