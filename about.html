                    <h2>Hey there!</h2>
                    <p>I'm Jessica—I live in Washington, DC and lead Community Growth at the <strong>Centre for Effective Altruism</strong>. My team of ~15 people works across groups, courses, and digital products to help people find ways to do more good in the world.</p>

            <h2>How I got here</h2>
            <p>Back in 2016, I watched Peter Singer's TED talk and fell down the effective altruism rabbit hole. I got involved with the EA community during college at Yale, where I studied computer science and ended up running Yale EA.</p>

            <p>After graduation, I kept coming back to this idea: the EA community had genuinely changed my career trajectory. If outreach programs could do that for me, maybe I could have a magnifying effect by helping shape not just my own path, but opening doors for others too.</p>

            <p>So I joined CEA. I started helping run university group programs, scaled up to lead the groups team, and now oversee our community growth portfolio. Along the way, I created the Organizer Support Program (which now supports 100+ EA groups globally), helped incubate Kairos, and launched programs like EA Bootcamp and our pilot unis initiative.</p>

            <h2>How I work</h2>
            <p>I'm a bit obsessed with how work actually gets done. I track my time religiously, do Pomodoros with colleagues on Gather, and have strong opinions about Slack hygiene. I've kept a gratitude journal for 150+ days and read 15+ books on leadership and management this year alone.</p>

            <p>I like structured work, well-prepared meetings, and keeping things moving. I give a lot of feedback and genuinely appreciate getting it back. Growth is kind of my thing—both for myself and for the people I work with.</p>

            <h2>This blog</h2>
            <p>I believe in learning in public. This blog is where I share productivity systems and workflows that actually work for me—time management, communication tools, how I structure my workday. Nothing fancy, just what's helped me get better at my job.</p>

            <h2>Outside of work</h2>
            <p>When I'm not thinking about productivity systems, you can find me playing volleyball, doing yoga, or planning elaborate themed parties.</p>
